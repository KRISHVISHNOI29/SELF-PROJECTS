A data analysis project done on a random Diwali Sales Data present on the internet.
This project covers performing EDA, Feature Engineering on the data set as well as visualization of the features, attributes and the data stored under them.
I have used PYTHON and JUPYTER for this task.
Uses of python's inbuilt data types like dictionary, list, etc is also involved in this project.
It covers the comparison among customers, product category, no. of orders, amount spent, customer's age group and many more.
Every comparison is divided into segments along with a markdown at the end which states the final outcome of the comparison
